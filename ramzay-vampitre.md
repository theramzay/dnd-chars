Converting your Vampire: The Masquerade character, RAMZAY, a Tzimisce vampire, to a Dungeons & Dragons character involves translating the unique aspects of the character while maintaining the core essence and abilities. Here’s how RAMZAY can be adapted to a D&D setting:

### Step-by-Step Conversion
